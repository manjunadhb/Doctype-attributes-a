      Mysore Dasara is the state festival in the state of Karnataka in India. It
      is a 10-day festival, starting with nine nights called Navaratri and the
      last day being Vijayadashami. The festival is observed on the tenth day in
      the Hindu calendar month of Ashvina, which typically falls in the
      Gregorian months of September and October.[1][2][3] The Hindu festival of
      Navaratri and its occasion of Vijayadashami celebrates the victory of good
      over evil. According to Hindu mythology, it commemorates the day the
      goddess Chamundeshwari (Durga) slew the demon Mahishasura.[4] Mahishasura
      is also believed to be the demon whose slaying by the goddess gave the
      city the name Mysuru. The Mysuru tradition celebrates the warriors and the
      state fighting for the good during this festival, ritually worshipping and
      displaying the state sword, weapons, elephants, horses, along with the
      goddess in her warrior form (predominantly) as well as the avatar of
      Vishnu, Rama. The ceremonies and a major procession is traditionally
      presided by the king of Mysuru.[4] The city of Mysuru has a long tradition
      of celebrating the Dasara festival with grandeur and pomp to mark the
      festival. The Dasara festival in Mysuru completed 409th anniversary in the
      year 2019,[5] while evidence suggests the festivities were observed in
      Karnataka state by the Vijayanagara Empire kings in the 15th century.[6]
